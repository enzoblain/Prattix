# 🧠 Prattix

**Prattix** is a Rust-based Pratt parser and lexer designed for parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions ➕➖✖️➗.  
This project serves as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of parsing algorithms 📚 and improve my Rust skills 🛠️ by implementing a top-down operator precedence parser from scratch.

## 🚧 Current Status

> 🛠️ Core tokenizer implemented for basic arithmetic expressions.  
> 🧮 Expression evaluation in progress.

## 🎯 Goals

### ✅ Core Parsing *(ongoing)*
- Tokenization of input into numbers and operators 🔢  
- Parsing expressions with correct operator precedence 🧩  
- Evaluating the resulting expression tree 🌳  

### 🛠️ Improvements *(planned)*
- Support for parentheses and unary operators 🧬  
- Building a full abstract syntax tree (AST) 🏗️  
- Better error handling and reporting 🧯  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Rust** — for safe, fast, and expressive parsing code ⚙️  
- **Enums & Pattern Matching** — core Rust features leveraged for clean token and operator handling 🧼  

## 🚀 Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/enzoblain/prattix
cd prattix
cargo run
```

Enter an arithmetic expression when prompted. The program tokenizes, parses, and evaluates the input.

## 📄 Why Prattix?

Building Prattix is about translating parsing theory into code 🧾 to solidify my computer science foundations 🧠.  
It challenges me to master Rust’s type system, pattern matching, and parsing techniques — essential skills for compiler or interpreter development 🧮.
